DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABSTRACT CLASS AND INTERFACE IN C#
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-c-sharp/
An abstract class is a way to achieve the abstraction in C#. An Abstract class is never intended to 
be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the
 keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. The Abstract classes are typically used to 
 define a base class in the class hierarchy.

Example:

filter_none

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of abstract class 
using System; 
  
// abstract class 'G' 
public abstract class G { 
  
    // abstract method 'gfg1()' 
    public abstract void gfg1(); 
} 
  
// class 'G' inherit 
// in child class 'G1' 
public class G1 : G { 
  
    // abstract method 'gfg1()' 
    // declare here with 
    // 'override' keyword 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is G1"); 
    } 
} 
  
// class 'G' inherit in 
// another child class 'G2' 
public class G2 : G { 
  
    // same as the previous class 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is  G2"); 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver Class 
public class main_method { 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main() 
    { 
  
        // 'obj' is object of class 
        // 'G' class ' 
        // G' cannot 
        // be instantiate 
        G obj; 
  
        // instantiate class 'G1' 
        obj = new G1(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G1' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
  
        // instantiate class 'G2' 
        obj = new G2(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G2' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
    } 
} 
Output :

Class name is G1
Class name is  G2
Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. The implementation of interfaceâ€™s members will be given by the class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.

Example:

filter_none

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of interface 
using System; 
  
// A simple interface 
interface interface1 { 
  
    // method having only declaration 
    // not definition 
    void show(); 
} 
  
// A class that implements the interface. 
class MyClass : interface1 { 
  
    // providing the body part of function 
    public void show() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!!!"); 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
  
        // Creating object 
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(); 
  
        // calling method 
        obj1.show(); 
    } 
}

Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract Class	Interface
It contains both declaration and definition part.	It contains only a declaration part.
Multiple inheritance is not achieved by abstract class.	Multiple inheritance is achieved by interface.
It contain constructor.	It does not contain constructor.
It can contain static members.	It does not contain static members.
It can contain different types of access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.	It only contains public access modifier because everything in the interface is public.
The performance of an abstract class is fast.	The performance of interface is slow because it requires time to search actual method in the corresponding class.
It is used to implement the core identity of class.	It is used to implement peripheral abilities of class.
A class can only use one abstract class.	A class can use multiple interface.
If many implementations are of the same kind and use common behavior, then it is superior to use abstract class.	If many implementations only share methods, then it is superior to use Interface.
Abstract class can contain methods, fields, constants, etc.	Interface can only contain methods .
It can be fully, partially or not implemented.	It should be fully implemented.
